      <p class="Content">Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started Tulis-Space, we’ve built our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. In our updated Terms and Privacy Policy you’ll find:</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Information that is easier to understand. Our updated Terms and Privacy Policy are easier to understand and reflect new features such as Tulis-Space Calling and Tulis-Space for web and desktop.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">We joined Local Publisher in 2014. Tulis-Space is now part of the Local Publisher family of companies. Our Privacy Policy explains how we work together to improve our services and offerings, like fighting spam across apps, making product suggestions, and showing relevant offers and ads on Local Publisher. Nothing you share on Tulis-Space, including your messages, photos, and account information, will be shared onto Local Publisher or any of our other family of apps for others to see, and nothing you post on those apps will be shared on Tulis-Space for others to see.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Your messages are yours, and we can’t read them. We’ve built privacy, end-to-end encryption, and other security features into Tulis-Space. We don’t store your messages once they’ve been delivered. When they are end-to-end encrypted, we and third parties can’t read them.</p>
      <p class="Content">No third-party banner ads. We still do not allow third-party banner ads on Tulis-Space.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">New ways to use Tulis-Space. We will explore ways for you and businesses to communicate with each other using Tulis-Space, such as through order, transaction, and appointment information, delivery and shipping notifications, product and service updates, and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you may receive containing marketing could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.</p>
      <p class="Content">The choices you have. If you are an existing user, you can choose not to have your Tulis-Space account information shared with Local Publisher to improve your Local Publisher ads and products experiences. Existing users who accept our updated Terms and Privacy Policy will have an additional 30 days to make this choice by going to Settings &gt; Account.</p>

For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Federal Arbitration Act. The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this “Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users” section, including any question whether a Dispute between Tulis-Space and you is subject to arbitration.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Agreement to Arbitrate for Tulis-Space Users Located in the United States or Canada. For Tulis-Space users located in the United States or Canada, Tulis-Space and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes. Tulis-Space and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. Tulis-Space and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the “AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at www.adr.org. The arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated. The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, we will reimburse you for all the AAA administrative fees in Disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a Dispute was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Opt-Out Procedure. You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms; and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt-out:</p>

      <p class="Content">Small Claims Court. As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local “small claims” court’s rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local “small claims” court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Time Limit to Start Arbitration. We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must commence an arbitration proceeding within one year after the Dispute first arose; otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred. This means that if we or you do not commence an arbitration within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, or Representative Actions for Users Located in the United States or Canada. We and you each agree that if you are a Tulis-Space user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people. We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable for a Dispute, then all of the provisions above under the caption “Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users” will be null and void as to that Dispute.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Place to File Permitted Court Actions.

      <p class="Content">Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started Tulis-Space, we’ve aspired to build our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Tulis-Space provides messaging, Internet calling, and other services to users around the world. Our Privacy Policy helps explain our information (including message) practices. For example, we talk about what information we collect and how this affects you. We also explain the steps we take to protect your privacy – like building Tulis-Space so delivered messages aren’t stored and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">When we say “Tulis-Space,” “our,” “we,” or “us,” we’re talking about Tulis-Space Inc. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all of our apps, services, features, software, and website (together, “Services”) unless specified otherwise.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Please also read Tulis-Space’s Terms of Service (“Terms”), which describes the terms under which you use our Services.</p>

      <p class="Content">Information We Collect</p>

      <p class="Content">Tulis-Space receives or collects information when we operate and provide our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Information You Provide</p>
      <p class="Content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Content">Your Account Information. You provide your mobile phone number to create a Tulis-Space account. You provide us the phone numbers in your mobile address book on a regular basis, including those of both the users of our Services and your other contacts. You confirm you are authorized to provide us such numbers. You may also add other information to your account, such as a profile name, profile picture, and status message.</p>
      <p class="Content">Your Messages. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Once your messages (including your chats, photos, videos, voice messages, files, and share location information) are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. Your messages are stored on your own device. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it. To improve performance and deliver media messages more efficiently, such as when many people are sharing a popular photo or video, we may retain that content on our servers for a longer period of time. We also offer end-to-end encryption for our Services, which is on by default, when you and the people with whom you message use a version of our app released after April 2, 2016. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.</p>
      <p class="Content">Your Connections. To help you organize how you communicate with others, we may create a favorites list of your contacts for you, and you can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information.</p>
      <p class="Content">Customer Support. You may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, and how to contact you so we can provide you customer support. For example, you may send us an email with information relating to our app performance or other issues.</p>

This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, browser information, IP address, mobile network information including phone number, and device identifiers. We collect device location information if you use our location features, such as when you choose to share your location with your contacts, view locations nearby or those others have shared with you, and the like, and for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes such as if you are having trouble with our app’s location features.</p>

      <p class="Content">Third-Party Providers. We work with third-party providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.
